@article{AdditiveManufacturingUsingMobileRobots,
   abstract = {In situ Additive Manufacturing (AM) has developed into an active research and industry-transfer area, mainly due to the increasing need for productive and sustainable methods in the concrete construction industry in combination with novel technological enablers. While current systems for in situ AM are often single large-scale stationary facilities, Mobile Additive Manufacturing (MAM) systems are an emerging technology that could provide scalability for AM processes on construction sites. This scalability is achievable through cooperability of multiple mobile robots on individual 3D printing tasks, while their mobility and autonomy enable deployment in both new and existing contexts, and coordination of operations for the direct and indirect interaction with humans. To ensure applicability and scalability, MAM closely integrates architectural, mechanical, and materials design, the manufacturing process, sensing, and control. With this paper, we give a comprehensive review of research trends, open questions and key performance indicators. We support the discussion with potential architectural application scenarios. Overall, we aim to indicate why addressing MAM is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge.},

@article{ConstructionFragmentation,
   abstract = {In general, fragmentation within the construction industry arises from two areas within the traditional construction process; the construction work process where the most significant division is in the separation of the design and construction phase, and the construction structure itself. The fragmentation process in traditional contracting practice further hinders the integration of construction knowledge among contractors, diminishing the opportunity for them to influence design decisions. When design professionals fail to consider as to how a contractor would construct the designed project results in scheduling problems, delays, and disputes during the construction process. Moving towards team integration is considered a significant strategy for overcoming the issue. Accordingly, this paper discusses the fragmentation issue in more detail including its definition, and causes and effects to the construction projects. It also explores that the team integration strategy alleviates scheduling problems, and helps avoid delays and disputes during the construction process, preventing harm to overall project performance.},

@article{Xu2021,
   abstract = {The Masonry wall (MW) is an important element of buildings. Currently, the detailed brick layout of a non-modular MW mostly relies on the experience from a bricklayer. The manual building information modeling (BIM) technique can facilitate the modeling of bricks, but is error-prone and time-consuming. This paper presents a BIM-based framework to generate the layouts and brick take-offs automatically. A computation module is developed to find the optimal brick layout using the three-stage optimization. For a MW, the first-stage determines the vertical position of each course and the second and third stages obtain the horizontal positions and sizes of bricks for odd and even courses respectively. The intelligent algorithm neighborhood field optimization is applied to the computation module. The proposed framework is applied in the automated detailing design of MWs with different bonds in two rooms to demonstrate its practicability and efficiency.},

Discover BIM: A better way to build better buildings Building Information Modeling (BIM) offers a novel approach to design, construction, and facility management in which a digital representation of the building product and process is used to facilitate the exchange and interoperability of information in digital format. BIM is beginning to change the way buildings look, the way they function, and the ways in which they are designed and built. The BIM Handbook, Third Edition provides an in-depth understanding of BIM technologies, the business and organisational issues associated with its implementation, and the profound advantages that effective use of BIM can provide to all members of a project team. Updates to this edition include: Information on the ways in which professionals should use BIM to gain maximum value New topics such as collaborative working, national and major construction clients, BIM standards and guides A discussion on how various professional roles have expanded through the widespread use and the new avenues of BIM practices and services A wealth of new case studies that clearly illustrate exactly how BIM is applied in a wide variety of conditions Painting a colourful and thorough picture of the state of the art in building information modeling, the BIM Handbook, Third Edition guides readers to successful implementations, helping them to avoid needless frustration and costs and take full advantage of this paradigm-shifting approach to construct better buildings that consume fewer materials and require less time, labor, and capital resources.

@article{Ding2014,
   abstract = {The utilization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been growing significantly and translating into the support of various tasks within the construction industry. In relation to such a growth, many approaches that leverage dimensions of information stored in BIM model are being developed. Through this, it is possible to allow all stakeholders to retrieve and generate information from the same model, enabling them to work cohesively. To identify gaps of existing work and evaluate new studies in this area, a BIM application framework is developed and discussed in this paper. Such a framework gives an overview of BIM applications in the construction industry. A literature review, within this framework, has been conducted and the result reveals a research gap for BIM applications in the project domains of quality, safety and environmental management. A computable multi-dimensional (nD) model is difficult to establish in these areas because with continuously changing conditions, the decision making rules for evaluating whether an individual component is considered good quality, or whether a construction site is safe, also vary as the construction progresses. A process of expanding from 3D to computable nD models, specifically, a possible way to integrate safety, quality and carbon emission variables into BIM during the construction phase of a project is explained in this paper. As examples, the processes of utilizing nD models on real construction sites are described. It is believed to benefit the industry by providing a computable BIM and enabling all project participants to extract any information required for decision making. Finally, the framework is used to identify areas to extend BIM research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
