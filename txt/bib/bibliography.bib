@article{AdditiveManufacturingUsingMobileRobots,
   abstract = {In situ Additive Manufacturing (AM) has developed into an active research and industry-transfer area, mainly due to the increasing need for productive and sustainable methods in the concrete construction industry in combination with novel technological enablers. While current systems for in situ AM are often single large-scale stationary facilities, Mobile Additive Manufacturing (MAM) systems are an emerging technology that could provide scalability for AM processes on construction sites. This scalability is achievable through cooperability of multiple mobile robots on individual 3D printing tasks, while their mobility and autonomy enable deployment in both new and existing contexts, and coordination of operations for the direct and indirect interaction with humans. To ensure applicability and scalability, MAM closely integrates architectural, mechanical, and materials design, the manufacturing process, sensing, and control. With this paper, we give a comprehensive review of research trends, open questions and key performance indicators. We support the discussion with potential architectural application scenarios. Overall, we aim to indicate why addressing MAM is an inherently multidisciplinary challenge.},

@article{ConstructionFragmentation,
   abstract = {In general, fragmentation within the construction industry arises from two areas within the traditional construction process; the construction work process where the most significant division is in the separation of the design and construction phase, and the construction structure itself. The fragmentation process in traditional contracting practice further hinders the integration of construction knowledge among contractors, diminishing the opportunity for them to influence design decisions. When design professionals fail to consider as to how a contractor would construct the designed project results in scheduling problems, delays, and disputes during the construction process. Moving towards team integration is considered a significant strategy for overcoming the issue. Accordingly, this paper discusses the fragmentation issue in more detail including its definition, and causes and effects to the construction projects. It also explores that the team integration strategy alleviates scheduling problems, and helps avoid delays and disputes during the construction process, preventing harm to overall project performance.},

@article{Xu2021,
   abstract = {The Masonry wall (MW) is an important element of buildings. Currently, the detailed brick layout of a non-modular MW mostly relies on the experience from a bricklayer. The manual building information modeling (BIM) technique can facilitate the modeling of bricks, but is error-prone and time-consuming. This paper presents a BIM-based framework to generate the layouts and brick take-offs automatically. A computation module is developed to find the optimal brick layout using the three-stage optimization. For a MW, the first-stage determines the vertical position of each course and the second and third stages obtain the horizontal positions and sizes of bricks for odd and even courses respectively. The intelligent algorithm neighborhood field optimization is applied to the computation module. The proposed framework is applied in the automated detailing design of MWs with different bonds in two rooms to demonstrate its practicability and efficiency.},
